## What is Pisko Lab?

Pisko Lab is a blog/portfolio/profile website. I created it because I was bored--
and because I wanted to have a little space on the web.

I used this project to learn and improve my skills in

- Accessibility;
- CSS;
- JavaScript;
- Algorithms; and
- Dynamic web pages.

## Technologies

Pisko Lab was written using absolutely zero frameworks. It was written in pure
HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
