## What is Pisko Lab?

Pisko Lab is a blog/portfolio/profile website. I created it because I was bored
-- and because I wanted to have a little space on the web.

I used this project to learn and improve my skills in

- Accessibility;
- CSS;
- JavaScript;
- Algorithms; and
- Dynamic web pages.

## How to run?

### 1. Clone this repository in your computer

First of all, you need to clone this repository in your computer. You can also
download and extract it, if you prefer.

### 2. Host a local server

You need to host a local server on your computer. You have two ways to do it.

#### 2. 1. Host using Python HTTP Server

To host a local server with Python, please

```sh
python -m http.server 8000
```

After that, you can open your preferred browser and navigate to
`http://localhost:8000`.

> **NOTE**: if Python fails with an error "Address already in use", try changing
the port number 8000 to another number. It **must** be greater than 1000.
**Make sure to replace it in the url as well**.

#### 2. 2. Host using VS Code live server

For this step, you need VS Code installed on your computer, and also you need
to have installed in VS Code the **Live Server extension from Ritwick Dey**.

> **NOTE**: VS Code may ask you to trust the repository in order to continue.

1. Open the repository folder with VS Code;
2. Go to the search bar and search for `>live server`;
3. Click on the option: `Live Server: Open with Live Server`.

VS Code will host the server and your default browser will open with the main
page of Pisko Lab.

## Technologies

Pisko Lab was written using absolutely zero frameworks. It was written in pure
